## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned
I learnt how to add CSS grids and combine them with CSS flexbox to make good designs.



```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-area: 
    'card-name card-arena';
  grid-area: card-name;
}
```

### Continued development


### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks](https://www.css-tricks.com) - This helped me to understand flexbox and grid layout. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Thoughtbot](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/concise-media-queries-with-css-grid) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand how to arrange grid using media queries. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
